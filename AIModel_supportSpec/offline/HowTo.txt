Train the model by running AIModel_supportSpec\offline\AI-offline-gpt2_resolution_modified.py
    This will train the model and also creates cache directory 
Now run rest.py 
    which will start Flask server and creates endpoints so that rest calls can be made
        example rest call: http://127.0.0.1:8000/generate_resolution
            Body: 
                {
                        "case_description": "The application crashes while reset the password."
                }
Prepare a client, where response can be presented in an HTML file. Just launch this
